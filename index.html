<h2>Why is it my favorite color?</h2>
<br>

<p>Blue has been my favorite color as long as I can remember. As a child everything in my room was blue, and I grew to love it. My dad had a really cool old car that was the blue that I liked the most. Also, as a child I loved Thomas the Tank Engine and he is also blue.</p>
<br>
<h2>What blue color schemes do I like?</h2>
<br>
<p>I like most all color schemes of blue. My favorite one to use is the monochromatic color scheme that I am using currently. Monochromatic schemes use different tones from the same part of the color wheel, using the same hue. I like using the blue monochromatic scheme because there are so many different blues, yet they are all from the same family. </p>

<h2>What are the general uses of colors?</h2>
<br>
<p>Colors have many uses in the world and online. They can express emotion, or a certain feeling that the designer is trying to portray by using them. Blue for example can portray feelings such as calmness, wisdom, or intelligence. People use it to boost their sales because blue boosts productivity. Also, certain colors can bring people in, and some colors can drive people away.</p>
